Question: Let \\[f(x) = \\left\\{{\\n\\begin{{array}}{{cl}} ax+3, &\\text{{ if }}x>2, \\\\\\nx-5 &\\text{{ if }} -2 \\le x \\le 2, \\\\\\n2x-b &\\text{{ if }} x <-2.\\n\\end{{array}}\\n\\right.\\]Find $a+b$ if the piecewise function is continuous (which means that its graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper). Let's think step by step.
Solution: For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must "meet" at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \\Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$. Substituting, we get $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$. So $a+b=-3+3=\\boxed{{0}}$.

Question: Sixteen is 64$\\%$ of what number? Let's think step by step.
Solution: If the number is $x$, we can set up the equation $\\frac{{16}}{{x}}=\\frac{{64}}{{100}}$. We divide both sides by $4$ to get $\\frac{{1}}{{x}}=\\frac{{4}}{{100}}=\\frac{{1}}{{25}}$, so $x=\\boxed{{25}}$.

Question: There are 3 complex numbers $a+bi$, $c+di$, and $e+fi$. If $b=1$, $e=-a-c$, and the sum of the numbers is $-i$, find $d+f$. Let's think step by step.
Solution: We know that $a+bi+c+di+e+fi=-i$. Thus, the real parts add up to 0 and the imaginary parts add up to -1. We then have  \\begin{{align}}\\na+c+e&=0\\\\\\nb+d+f&=-1\\\\\\n\\end{{align}}We know that $b=1$, therefore $d+f=\\boxed{{-2}}$
